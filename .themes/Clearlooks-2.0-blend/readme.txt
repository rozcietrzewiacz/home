Change log:

v1.0:
 * Dark border on bottom of unfocused title removed so that title bar blends more with window body
 * Dark border on bottom of focused title lightened so that change from unfocused and no line to focused isn't so major
 * Outer border of unfocused windows lightened so that background windows are more subtle and subdued
